This module imports various functions from the 'os' and 'os.path' modules to facilitate file and directory operations, as well as command execution. It is designed for use in a Python script located at 'd:\\Proccess\\Python3\\FFMPEG\\AV Efficent\\VideoEfficentConvert.py'.
"""
from os import system as cmd, chdir, getcwd, popen as rcmd, rename, remove, _exit as exit
"""
This module imports essential functions from the 'os.path' and 'tkinter.filedialog' modules to facilitate file path manipulations and file selection dialogues, respectively. These functionalities are crucial for handling file operations within the application, such as opening files for video conversion processes.
"""
from os.path import split as sp, splitext as spt, basename as bn, exists, expanduser
"""
This line imports the `askopenfilenames` function from the `tkinter.filedialog` module and renames it as `askfls`. This function is used to open a dialog box that allows the user to select multiple files. It is typically used in GUI applications to enable file selection.
"""
from tkinter.filedialog import askopenfilenames as askfls
"""
Import the sleep function from the time module to allow for pausing execution in the code.
"""
from time import sleep
"""
Import the datetime module to facilitate date and time operations within the script.
"""
from datetime import datetime
# Importing the 'sub' function from the 're' module
# This function is used for replacing occurrences of a particular pattern
# with a replacement string, which is useful for text processing tasks
# within the VideoEfficentConvert script.
from re import sub

This script initializes the Tkinter library, which is used for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Python.
"""
import tkinter as tk

"""
Sets up the main window for the application, making it always on top and initially hidden.

"""
This variable `init_dir` is initialized to the path of the user's 'Downloads' directory using the `expanduser` function. It is likely used as a starting point for file operations within the script, such as saving or loading files related to video efficient conversion.
"""
init_dir = expanduser('~\\Downloads\\')
"""
compress_rate: A float value representing the compression rate to be applied during video conversion. This value should be between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates no compression and 1 indicates maximum compression.
"""
compress_rate = 0.4

Validates and renames a filename according to specified rules.

This function splits the input filename into its base name and extension, replaces invalid characters with underscores based on the global `invalid_filename_rule`, and then renames the file accordingly.

Parameters:
- i (str): The original filename to be validated and renamed.

Returns:
- str: The new, validated filename.

get_video_inputs()

This function prompts the user to select video files for processing. It uses a graphical interface to allow the selection of multiple video files with extensions .mp4, .avi, .flv, and .mkv from the initial directory specified by the global variable `init_dir`.

Returns:
    List[str]: A list of file paths for the selected video files.

get_video_bitrate(vp)

Calculate the video bitrate of a given video file.

Parameters:
vp (str): The path to the video file.

Returns:
int: The video bitrate in kilobits per second (kbps).

This function uses the 'ffprobe' command-line tool to extract the video bitrate from the specified video file.
